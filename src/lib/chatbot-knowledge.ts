  {
    keywords: ['rent increase', 'rent guidelines board', 'rgb', 'how much can rent go up'],
    category: 'Rent Increases',
    response: `üìà RENT INCREASES - KNOW THE RULES

How much your rent can increase depends on whether you're rent-stabilized or market-rate.

RENT-STABILIZED APARTMENTS:
‚úÖ Increases LIMITED by Rent Guidelines Board (RGB)
‚úÖ RGB sets rates annually (usually 1-3%)
‚úÖ For 1-year lease: one rate
‚úÖ For 2-year lease: higher rate (but spread over 2 years)
‚úÖ Landlord CANNOT charge more than RGB rate

2024 RGB RATES (example):
‚Ä¢ 1-year lease: up to 3%
‚Ä¢ 2-year lease: up to 2.75%
(Rates change yearly - check current rates)

WHEN CAN RENT-STABILIZED RENT INCREASE:
‚Ä¢ At lease renewal only
‚Ä¢ By RGB percentage
‚Ä¢ Plus any approved MCI or IAI (see below)
‚Ä¢ Plus vacancy increase (if new tenant)

MARKET-RATE APARTMENTS:
‚Ä¢ No legal limit on increases
‚Ä¢ Landlord can raise rent to any amount
‚Ä¢ Usually at lease renewal
‚Ä¢ Month-to-month: 30 days notice required

RENT INCREASES THAT ARE ILLEGAL:
‚ùå Mid-lease (unless lease says otherwise)
‚ùå Without proper notice (30 days for month-to-month)
‚ùå Above RGB rates (rent-stabilized)
‚ùå Retaliatory increases
‚ùå As punishment for complaints

MAJOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS (MCI):
‚Ä¢ Building-wide improvements (new roof, boiler, windows, etc.)
‚Ä¢ Landlord can add temporary surcharge
‚Ä¢ Must be approved by DHCR
‚Ä¢ You can challenge MCI application
‚Ä¢ Increases limited to 2% per year (rent-stabilized)
‚Ä¢ MCI increases are TEMPORARY (removed after paid off)

INDIVIDUAL APARTMENT IMPROVEMENTS (IAI):
‚Ä¢ Improvements to YOUR apartment
‚Ä¢ Can increase rent if substantial improvements
‚Ä¢ Landlord must have receipts
‚Ä¢ New limits under 2019 law:
  - Capped at 1/168th of cost (over 12.5 years)
  - Maximum $15,000 over 15 years
‚Ä¢ You can challenge if work wasn't done

PREFERENTIAL RENT:
‚Ä¢ If you pay LESS than legal regulated rent
‚Ä¢ Under new law (2019): preferential rent is "sticky"
‚Ä¢ Increases limited to RGB rates on preferential rent
‚Ä¢ Landlord cannot jump to legal regulated rent

VACANCY INCREASES (Rent-Stabilized):
When tenant moves out, landlord can increase for new tenant:
‚Ä¢ Vacancy lease increase (varies by lease term)
‚Ä¢ Plus longevity increase (if previous tenant there 8+ years)
‚Ä¢ Plus IAI (if improvements made)
‚Ä¢ But must follow DHCR rules

HOW TO CHALLENGE ILLEGAL INCREASE:
1. Check if you're rent-stabilized
2. Request rent history from DHCR
3. Compare to legal rent
4. File DHCR overcharge complaint
5. Get legal help: (212) 577-3300

IF LANDLORD DEMANDS ILLEGAL INCREASE:
‚Ä¢ Don't pay it
‚Ä¢ Pay only legal amount
‚Ä¢ File DHCR complaint
‚Ä¢ Document everything
‚Ä¢ Get legal help

NOTICE REQUIREMENTS:
‚Ä¢ Rent-stabilized: Landlord must give you renewal lease 90-150 days before expiration
‚Ä¢ Renewal lease shows new rent
‚Ä¢ You have 60 days to sign and return

NEGOTIATING INCREASES:
‚Ä¢ Market-rate: You can negotiate
‚Ä¢ Ask for smaller increase
‚Ä¢ Offer longer lease for smaller increase
‚Ä¢ Landlord may want to keep good tenant

MAJOR RED FLAGS:
üö© Huge sudden increase (market-rate)
üö© Increase above RGB rate (rent-stabilized)
üö© No proper notice
üö© Increase mid-lease
üö© Retaliatory increase after complaint

GET CURRENT RGB RATES:
Visit: rentguidelinesboard.cityofnewyork.us
